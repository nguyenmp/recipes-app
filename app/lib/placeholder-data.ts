To ensure the best flavor, be sure to brown the pancetta-vegetable mixture in step 4 until the fond on the bottom of the pot is quite dark. The cooked sauce will look thin but will thicken once tossed with the pasta. Tagliatelle is a long, flat, dry egg pasta that is about 1/4 inch wide; if you can\u2019t find it, you can substitute pappardelle. Substituting other pasta may result in a too-wet sauce.  \nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Toss beef with water, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside.  \n2. While beef sits, bring broth to boil over high heat in large pot (this pot will be used to cook pasta in step 6\\) and cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes; set aside.  \n3. Pulse pancetta in food processor until finely chopped, 15 to 20 pulses. Add onion, carrot, and celery and pulse until vegetables are finely chopped and mixture has paste-like consistency, 12 to 15 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.  \n4. Heat butter and oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. When foaming subsides, add pancetta-vegetable mixture and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Spread mixture in even layer in bottom of pot and continue to cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until very dark browned bits form on bottom of pot, 7 to 12 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste is rust-colored and bottom of pot is dark brown, 1 to 2 minutes.  \n5. Reduce heat to medium, add beef, and cook, using wooden spoon to break meat into pieces no larger than 1/4 inch, until beef has just lost its raw pink color, 4 to 7 minutes. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Cook until wine has evaporated and sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth and Parmesan. Return sauce to simmer; cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes (sauce will look thin). Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.  \n6. Rinse pot that held broth. While sauce simmers, bring 4 quarts water to boil in now-empty pot. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, then drain pasta. Add pasta to pot with sauce and toss to combine. Adjust sauce consistency with reserved cooking water as needed. Transfer to platter or individual bowls and serve, passing extra Parmesan separately.\n\n",

Wait for 5-10 minutes with the flame stop  \n5 \\- Warm up in the microwave 2 cups of milk, 45s  \n6 \\- add 5 tablespoons (\u2153 cups) of sugar (or honey/date syrup) and the milk. Start the flame to low/medium  \n7 \\- Get it to a boil and after boiling leave it 5 minutes boiling (not too hard, just enough to boil)  \n8 \\- Stop the flame and filter the tea, moving it from container to container so it mixes all the flavors and creates a layer of bubbles  \n9 \\- Enjoy\n\nFirst attempt missed star anise and used different cinnamon.  Was a bit off, kind of bitter.  We got ceylon cinnamon and followed the recipe much more closely and it was pretty good.\n\nI feel like the flavors have gotten a lot more muted over time. Maybe it's letting it cool that brings out the flavors.  The milk is always overpowering at first.  Then the sugars when it's boiled.\n\nI've been doing like 150% quantities of spices to compensate for hard water., except peppers, too spicy.\n\nMilk for 1:30\n\nDivyani Rao mentioned that many people switch blends between the warmer (ginger, black peppercorn, etc) to the cooler (tulsi, green cardamom, turmeric).

I ended up salting the chicken while letting it cool and resting in the fridge.  Let\u2019s see how that goes.\n\nThe broth was also not salted enough, needed a generous pinch.  Ended up producing 1.75 cups total liquid using 2 drums and 4 thighs, maybe 1.5 lbs?\n\nIn the future, do all the \u201cmincing\u201d in a food processor.  That was like 80% of the active time.  Everything else like mixing the sauces was easy but tedious.\n\nFor the soy sauce dip, I found more sugar and less alcohol to be appropriate.  I found the alcohol overpowering and the soy sauce I used was very salty and strong.  More sesame oil too maybe?  IDK what 2 drops is but I did more than that I think and it wasn\u2019t enough for my tastes.\n\nFor the ginger oil dip, a little more salt than expected, but it should taste a little salty, since that\u2019s what i\u2019ve seen at restaurants and it\u2019s fun and delicious since the chicken is a little bland.  Triple the volume.\n\nChili sauce was very spicy, maybe use half the volume which was primarily sambal.  Lime was good though.\n\nI tossed the filtered aromatics into the trash.  Recipe didn\u2019t call for more and I didn\u2019t see the value in keeping it.  I think food processing would havebeen nice.\n\nEnded up dicing a small salad bowl of cabbage to make into a broth.  Excited\\!  Need to augment with more broth though, not enough liquid.\n\nThe rice was a little bland but texture was really good.  Salt the broth more next time, maybe don't dilute with water, use full strength broth.\n\n1 cup rice raw was adequate for two people, two for leftovers.  1-1 ratio of liquid was amazing.  Disable keep warm function\n\n",

Aim for 1.5 lbs, good for 2 people.  More than 2.5 lbs gets tricky because the tail is overcooked but the belly undercooked.  For larger fish, chop into smaller chunks for even cooking, or pan fry them instead.\n\nScaled, gutted, whole fresh fish. I usually leave the head and tail on but no fins. Look for Mexican or Asian supermarkets.\n\nWe use a large wok with a lid to steam by putting a plate over a metal thing.  Plate on spoons in a large sauce pan or pot also works.\n\n1. On a plate, stuff fish with green onion, top with ginger slices.  Optionally place 2\u201d pieces of whites of green onion below fish to lift it up.  \n2. Mix \\~2tbsp soy sauce, \\~1tbsp sugar, and 1 tbsp \\[mirin or sake or xiao shing or white wine\\].  Sweet is good.  Every soy sauce is different, taste yours for salty sweet balance.  \n3. Steam well covered over medium heat on aggressively boiling water for \\~6 minutes per lbs or when center is 110F.  Residual heat will make it land at 120-125F.   Thermometer is super useful here, but you can just check with a fork for flakiness.  \n4. Pour out the accumulated water from the plate, it\u2019s bitter and foul.  \n5.

Whole Wheat Flour  \n50-100 gr. sugar (depending on amount of honey)\n\n1. Put the warm water in a large bowl, mix in the yeast, and half the honey. I use an electric mixer with the two kneading hooks, for this process. Mix in the white bread flour, one cup after the other, and make sure it's properly mixed before adding the next. When all 5 cups are mixed and the mixture is even, and without any lumps, put a cloth over the bowl.  \n2. Let the mixture heave for 30-45 minutes, depending on temperature, or until double in size. It should be big and bubbly.  \n3. Now take a ladle/wooden spoon, and mix in the melted butter. Take care to melt butter slowly so it doesn't separate. Mix in the rest of the honey, sugar, salt, until totally mixed.  \n4. Mix in the Whole Wheat Flour with the ladle/spoon, one cup at a time, until the dough is kneadable. This is usually around 2-3 cups.  \n5. Now sprinkle a table with some Whole Wheat Flour, and start kneading the dough by hand for 10-15 minutes with the rest of the Whole Wheat flour, adding a small amount of Whole Wheat Flour step by step. When the dough is perfect, shape into a ball, cover lightly with Whole Wheat Flour all around.  \n6. Take a clean bowl, sprinkle the bottom with a little Whole Wheat Flour, put the dough in and cover with a damp cloth. Let it heave for 30-45 minutes, depending on temperature, until doubled in size.  \n7. Turn the bowl on it's top and gently shake the bowl until the dough falls on the table. Cut into 2 pieces and rub some Whole Wheat Flour around it. Place the pieces on a rack with some baking paper.  \n8. Put a cloth on top of the rack, and let the dough heave for the third time, for 15-30 minutes, into it's final form. Don't heave to much or it will start to crack open. Now the dough is ready and shall not be disturbed before baking  \n9. Place the rack into a preheated convection oven, bake for 30 minutes at 175C. Optionally place a baking form in the bottom of the oven, and pour a glass of water into it, making it hiss. This will insure that the bread stays moist.  \n10. Take out the rack, and using a small piece of butter, smear the outside of the bread with the melting butter. You can also use olive-oil in a spray can.  \n11. Let the bread cool down completely before slicing it.\n\nEnjoy\\!\n\n",

Pre-heat oven to 350-375F (175C-190)  \n2. Cut the tip off the dates and remove the pits, if there. Make a small cut down the center but only through one side of the skin. You want them to open up similar to a hard shell taco.  \n3. Take a small finger amount of goat cheese and fill the cavity.  \n4. Halve your bacon strips and wrap the date in bacon, I personally like to wrap them so that all of the date is covered, even the tips. If you do have exposed areas, make sure it's the raw side of the date exposed and not the goat cheese cavity.  \n5. Place on wire rack stacked in a baking sheet and bake in the center of the oven till bacon is at your desired finish. For crispy, expect 20-30 minutes or 5-10 minutes after the fat has begun to liquidate and they start to sizzle.\n\n",

Easy work: Melt some butter in a pan and gently cook a corn tortilla in it. Top the tortilla with grated Cheddar, a slice of deli ham or some cooked bacon if you want them, a little chopped cilantro or salsa or hot sauce, and another tortilla. Cook, flipping the quesadilla a few times, until it is crisp and golden and the cheese has melted into lace at the sides. Use a spatula to pull it out of the pan, and place it onto a cutting board to rest. Fry an egg in the now-empty pan with a little more butter, then cut the quesadilla into quarters, placing the egg on top. Top with cilantro and hot sauce or salsa.\n\n",

Here, that is achieved with the help of a sheet pan and an intensely hot oven. To ensure optimal crunch, start with the pan on the bottom rack to crisp the underside of the noodles, then move it up to the highest to encourage crackly noodles on top, too. Instant ramen noodles are the perfect choice for this recipe because they crisp up flawlessly; just soak them in boiling hot water to loosen them up before sliding them into the oven. The hoisin-marinated tofu is subtly sweet and carries a lot of the flavor in this noodle dish. Quick cooking baby bok choy adds freshness, but you could also use leftover vegetables or seasonal produce.\n\nNoodles, Vegetables, Bok Choy, Hoisin Sauce, Ramen, Tofu, Dinner, Main Course, Vegan, Vegetarian  Mark as  Cooked  2,647 ratings   \nINGREDIENTS  \nFOR THE NOODLES:  \n3  blocks instant ramen noodles (about 9 ounces), flavor packets discarded  \n2  tablespoons sesame oil  \n2  tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or vegetable  \n2  tablespoons soy sauce  \n Kosher salt  \n1  14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices  \n3  baby bok choy, trimmed and sliced vertically into 4 pieces  \n Handful of cilantro leaves  \nFOR THE MARINADE:  \n2  tablespoons hoisin  \n1  tablespoon sesame oil  \n1  tablespoon maple syrup  \n1  garlic clove, grated  \n1  teaspoon sesame seeds\n\nPREPARATION\n\n1. Heat the oven to 450 degrees and place one rack on the top and one on the bottom. Fill a kettle or medium pot with water (about 8 cups) and bring to a boil. Place the noodles in a heat-proof bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak for 5 minutes, then drain. Set aside the bowl to use in Step 5\\.  \n2. Make the marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the hoisin sauce, sesame oil, maple syrup, garlic and sesame seeds.  \n3. Place the noodles on a sheet pan. Add the sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of neutral oil, soy sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. Toss to combine, then spread the noodles out evenly.  \n4. Dip each tofu slice into the marinade, coating both sides, then add them to the sheet pan, pushing the noodles aside so that the tofu touches the pan and doesn\u2019t just sit on top of the noodles. Place on the bottom rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reserve excess marinade.  \n5. Place the baby bok choy into the reserved bowl, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon of neutral oil and 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and toss to coat.  \n6. Remove the sheet pan from the oven (the noodles should be crisp on the bottom and around the edges) and add the bok choy to the pan. Return the sheet pan to the top rack of the oven and bake for 4 to 7 minutes until the greens are vibrant with crispy edges, and the top of the noodles are crispy. Drizzle with the remaining marinade, top with cilantro leaves and serve.\n\n",

Basically a normal salad but served \u201cwarm\u201d with cooked mushrooms.\n\nJenny found the salad to be one-dimensional because it was bitter and overly acidic.  I liked it al ot and she liked it mixed with the spiced lentils.\n\n",

I used red lentils, it was a little bit \u201csoupy\u201d but soaked up real well at the end.  Finished uncovered.  Jenny liked the moderate spiciness of it.  Don\u2019t   \noverdo it though.\n\nJenny says no cumin in the future,.,.  Too heavy and \u201cspiced\u201d.\n\nMaybe next time: [https://www.recipetineats.com/lentil-soup/](https://www.recipetineats.com/lentil-soup/)\n\n",
