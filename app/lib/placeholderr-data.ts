Rice was a LITTLE dry and bottom was starting to crisp.\n5 minute timer.\nTurn off fire, rice is a bit tough, like fried rice should be, and the middle is a bit crunchy, the bottom grains are a bit crunchy.\n5 minute timer\n\nWill the final wait in steam work out to finish cooking the rice? Mostly! It’s like 90% of the way there. Leaving it over the hot burner meant the inside is still 190F with steam.\n5 minute timer.\n\nShould I have added more water? **1.5-1.75:1 ratio of water to rice** might be good. I think 2 is too much? Should I soak? Nah.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsHLgZhkKyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsHLgZhkKyc) Chinese Cooking Demystified did 1.2 rice to 1 water for fired rice, super dry.\n\nI think 1 water to 1 rice would be happy for me, cook for 10 minutes, stop.\n1.5 to 1 would be 15 minutes, stop for 10 minutes.\n\nKenji says 1.1:1 water to rice, boil, low for 15 minutes, rest for 10.",
